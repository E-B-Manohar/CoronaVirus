# Android Applications
## COV_IN.APK
I've created this app to bring awareness among my fellow citizens in Indian Nation about the what Indian Government's Ministry of Health is doing to help my nation to solve this CoViD-19 crisis.
<br>The app contains mainly two websites, 
1. The crowdsourced tracking of Corona cases: https://www.covid19india.org/
2. Indian Government's Ministry of Health's notifications: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/
<br>This updates citizens of what is currently happening. No Misinformations whatsoever in the Application interface. Clean application.

<br>Though I'm not an android app programer, I've used a free web application: http://appinventor.mit.edu/
<br>'AppInventor' allows us to create android applications using block programming. 

<p>I created this app as my contribution to fight against COVID-19 in my country.
<br>I'm hoping that whoever have better skills can contribute to develop better apps and help each other.
